Rationals
===============
You will work with an existing code base to design an interface and two classes that are implementations of that interface. The classes will store a fraction. The fractions consist of a numerator and denominator field. The methods in the class will be operations to add, subtract, multiply, etc. two Rationals.

The classes generally follow a philosophy of immutability, in which the methods do not alter either of the Rationals being operated on but instead return a third new Rational that is the result of the operation.
